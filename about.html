                As Rock n Roll swept the globe throughout the 1960s, so followed the demand for electric guitars. This demand eventually crossed the iron curtain into the USSR, despite the best efforts of the Soviet government. Rock music and electric guitars were deemed objects of capitalist decadence, and thus were banned in the Soviet Union for many years. Soviet rockers however found ways of smuggling guitars from neighboring countries. In 1969, the Soviet government finally allowed for the production of electric guitars on the condition that the guitars cannot imitate American designs, and instead must embrace a Soviet design sensibility.

                From this negotiation resulted some of the most interesting and wacky guitar designs that go underappreciated to this day. The first electric guitar design approved by the Soviet government, the “Tonika”, however unplayable, exemplifies the desire to contrast American design and to present a competing ideal. The small, asymmetrical body of the Tonika appears to have been designed by someone who had never seen an electric guitar, but instead had one described to them over the phone. This oddball of a guitar served as the basis for all future Soviet guitar models to come. This website records some, but not all, of these fascinating instruments from the Soviet Union and satellite states.
